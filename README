This is a barebones project template that will run on the server
Before starting you need:
Python3.6
pip
venv (`pip3 install venv`)


To start, run `make install`. This will set up a virtual environment in the current directory under venv/.
Read more on venv here (before asking me questions):

https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/#usage


The Makefile I have provided for you does not require you to activate your virtualenv.
If you did not understand what that last sentence meant, please read above resources.
If you wish to activate your virtualenv, read above resources.

The Makefile runs all tests in {Project}/test/
To run tests, simply run `make run`

If you want to clean up the __pycache__ folders or borked the install, run
`make clean`

How this project makes imports work:
In the Makefile, this is the line that makes the magic happen:
`pip install -e .`
This line installs our local project into pip, enabling our packages to be imported.
This installation is handled via the setup.py (read more):

Inside of the gone project, there is are demo files that try to show how importing is done.
Follow this pattern to the best of your ability.
If you have questions, read up on how packages work (above) and then talk to me if you need more help.
